# MTAV Administrator Guide

Welcome to the Administration Panel! This guide will help you efficiently manage your housing cooperative, from inviting new members to organizing lotteries and events.

## Getting Started

The dashboard is your starting point. Here you'll find a complete summary of your cooperative: how many families are registered, the number of active members, available and assigned units, scheduled events, and system administrators. All this information allows you to have a panoramic view of the cooperative's current state in one place.

Navigation is intuitive thanks to the left sidebar. From there you access all the main sections of the system: Dashboard for the overview, Families to manage family groups, Members to administer each person individually, Projects to configure your housing projects, Units to manage types and availability, Lottery for unit assignment, Events to organize community activities, Gallery for shared media, and Logs for system auditing.

## Managing Members

Member management is one of the most frequent tasks. To invite someone new, simply navigate to the Members section and click "Invite Member". Complete the form with the email address (which is mandatory), full name, the project they'll belong to, and optionally their family. The new member will automatically receive an email with all the necessary instructions to complete their registration.

Managing existing members is just as simple. Click on any member to view their complete profile, use the edit button to update their data when necessary. If a member needs to be temporarily deactivated, you can do so without deleting their history, thus maintaining full traceability. Complete deletion is only available for accounts that have no associated history, preventing accidental loss of important information.

Pending invitations deserve special attention. Filter by "Invited" status to see who hasn't accepted their invitation yet, when it was sent, and you'll have the option to resend it if necessary or cancel it if it's no longer valid.

## Working with Projects

Creating a new project is the first step in organizing your cooperative. Go to the Projects section, click "New Project" and complete the basic information: project name, a clear description, location, and estimated start date. This information will be fundamental for members to understand what options are available.

Each project can have multiple unit types. You might have one, two, or three-bedroom apartments, individual houses, duplexes, or custom configurations according to your cooperative's needs. For each unit type you'll need to define a descriptive name that members can easily understand, the total quantity available, estimated price, and any special features that differentiate them.

## The Lottery System

The lottery is perhaps the most important moment in your cooperative's life. Preparation is key: before running the lottery, make sure all members have set their unit preferences, verify that all units are correctly configured in the system, and clearly define the lottery rules including priorities and how possible ties will be handled.

When the time comes to run the lottery, navigate to the corresponding section and select the project. Carefully review the assignment algorithm configuration, priority criteria, and tie-breaking rules. Once you execute the lottery, you can review the results before confirming them definitively. The system will automatically notify all members about their assignments.

Lottery results are saved in the history for future reference, you can export them in CSV or PDF format for official reports, and each member will be able to see their assignment directly in their profile.

## Organizing Events

Events are fundamental to maintaining an active community. Creating an event is simple: go to the Events section, click "Create Event" and complete the basic information such as title, description, date and time, location, and if desired, a maximum attendee capacity.

RSVP tracking allows you to know exactly who will attend, how many guests each family will bring, and you can send automatic reminders as the date approaches. Additionally, you have the option to export the complete attendee list for logistical organization.

## Managing Families

Families allow grouping related members under the same family unit. When you create a new family group, give it a descriptive name and assign the members that compose it, defining who is the main member or family head.

The benefits of working with families are multiple: preferences can be shared during the lottery, they facilitate group communication, allow generating family reports, and simplify joint fee management.

## Gallery and Multimedia Content

The gallery allows the community to share important moments. As an administrator, your role includes approving or rejecting content uploaded by members, organizing it by categories or projects, establishing clear usage policies, and moderating comments when necessary.

It's important to monitor storage usage, set reasonable limits per user, and periodically clean old or no longer relevant content to keep the system running optimally.

## Audit System

The log system is your best ally for maintaining transparency and security. Every important administrative action is recorded: who performed it, what exactly changed, when it occurred, and from which IP address it originated.

You can filter these records by specific user, action type, date range, or affected entity to quickly find what you need. Log exports allow you to generate audit reports for regulatory compliance, incident investigation, or system usage analysis.

## System Configuration

User permission management is crucial. The system handles three levels: Super Admin with full access to all functions, Admin with day-to-day operational management, and Member with limited access only to their own data.

Automatic notifications can be configured according to your cooperative's needs: automatic emails with customizable templates, adjustable reminder frequency, and push notifications when appropriate.

System customization allows you to give identity to your cooperative: add the official logo, adjust theme colors to match your brand, update contact information, and clearly establish terms and conditions.

## Reports and Analysis

The system offers various ready-to-use reports: financial summaries by project, complete member listings with all their information, updated unit status, event attendance reports, and system activity analysis.

You can export this data in multiple formats: CSV for working in spreadsheets, PDF for presentable formal documents, or JSON if you need integrations with other systems.

## Best Practices

Security should be a constant priority. Change your password regularly, never share your administrator credentials with anyone, periodically review system logs, and always keep your contact information updated.

Regarding communication, keep members informed about important changes that may affect them, respond quickly to their inquiries to maintain trust, use events as a tool to keep the community active and engaged, and publish regular updates on project progress.

Preventive maintenance will save you problems: review pending invitations monthly and follow up, keep all project information updated, periodically clean data that's no longer relevant, and perform regular backups of critical information.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Can I delegate administrative tasks?** Yes, you can create multiple administrator accounts with different permission levels according to each person's responsibilities.

**What if I send an invitation to an incorrect email?** No problem. You can cancel the invitation from the Members section and send a new one to the correct email without major complications.

**How do I change lottery settings after running it?** Once executed, the lottery cannot be modified to maintain process transparency. However, you can run a new lottery with different parameters if absolutely necessary.

**Can members see other members' data?** Members can only see basic information such as name and project of other members. Sensitive personal data is protected and only visible to administrators.

**How do I export the complete member list?** Go to the Members section, click the Export button, select your preferred format (CSV or Excel), and download the file with all the information.
