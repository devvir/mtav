## Selecting Your Unit Preferences

**This is the most important feature of the app!** Your preferences determine which home your family might receive in the lottery.

### What Are Preferences?

Preferences are your ranked list of homes. You tell us:

- **1st choice**: The unit you'd most like to have
- **2nd choice**: Your backup if you can't get your first choice
- **3rd choice**: Your next backup
- And so on...

### Your Unit Type

Your family has been assigned a **unit type** (for example: Small, Medium, Large, or specific bedroom counts). You can only choose from units that match your family's type.

**Why?** This ensures fair matching - larger families get larger homes, smaller families get appropriate-sized homes.

### How to Select Preferences

**Where**: Dashboard ‚Üí "Family Preferences" or "Units" ‚Üí "Select Preferences"

**Steps**:

1. Browse the available units (only your unit type will show)
2. Look at floor plans, photos, and unit details (bedrooms, size, balcony, garden, floor level)
3. Click "Add to Preferences" for units you like
4. Drag to reorder them (most preferred at the top)
5. Click "Save Preferences"

**Important**:

- ‚úÖ **Anyone in your family can update preferences** - discuss together and decide as a family
- ‚úÖ **You can change anytime** - until the lottery happens, you can update freely
- ‚úÖ **We'll notify you of changes** - if new units are added, or if a unit you selected is modified or removed, we'll send you an email. Remember: the original plan of some projects may change over time

### Tips for Choosing

- **Consider everything**: Location in the building, floor level, sunlight, garden/balcony, nearby amenities
- **Rank honestly**: The lottery works best when you rank units in your true order of preference
- **Discuss with your family**: Make sure everyone's needs are considered
- **Update if needed**: Changed your mind? You can update anytime before the lottery

## Understanding the Lottery

The **lottery** (sorteo) is how we fairly assign homes to families.

### How It Works

**Step 1: All families submit preferences**

- Every family ranks their preferred units
- You can update your preferences anytime before the lottery date

**Step 2: Administrator sets the lottery date**

- You'll receive an email notification with the date
- Make sure your preferences are finalized before this date!

**Step 3: The lottery runs**

- A computer program considers everyone's preferences at the same time
- It uses advanced methods to find the fairest possible assignment
- The goal: maximize the chance of each family getting their top choices

**Step 4: Results announced**

- Every family receives a unit assignment
- You'll see which unit you got and your satisfaction rating (1-5 stars)
- Results are final

### Your Unit Type and the Lottery

**Important**: There's a separate lottery for each unit type.

For example:

- Families with "Large" type compete for Large units
- Families with "Medium" type compete for Medium units

You're only in the lottery with families of the same type as yours.

### What Is a Satisfaction Rating?

Your rating shows how well the result matched your preferences on a scale of 1-5 stars:

- **‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (5 stars)**: You got your top choice
- **‚≠ê (1 star)**: You got your least preferred option, but it was the fairest outcome given everyone's needs

**Remember**: The lottery maximizes fairness for ALL families, not just one. Everyone gets the best possible outcome when all preferences are considered together.

### What If There's a Problem?

Results are final, but in **very rare exceptional situations** (like a serious error), an administrator can invalidate the lottery and run it again. You'll be notified if this happens.
