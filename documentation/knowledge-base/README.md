## ðŸ”„ Update Workflow

**Important**: Do not edit files in this directory manually.

**Correct workflow**:

1. **Identify issue** in derived doc or application code
2. **Report to AI** - "The Member Guide says X but it should be Y"
3. **AI updates KB** first (KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md)
4. **AI regenerates** affected derived documents
5. **Review** updated derived docs
6. **Commit** changes together (KB + derived docs in sync)

This ensures:

- âœ… Single source of truth maintained
- âœ… No contradictions between documents
- âœ… All docs stay synchronized
- âœ… Changes traceable to KB updates
