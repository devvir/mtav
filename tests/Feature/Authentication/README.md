# Authentication Test Group

The tests in this group validate authentication flows including login, logout, and session management.

These tests ensure that the authentication system correctly handles user credentials, session lifecycle, and redirects based on user state and project context.

## Usage
To run the whole group: `mtav test --pest --group Feature.Authentication`
