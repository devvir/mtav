  <h1>Member Guide - MTAV</h1>
  <p class="lead">
    Welcome to MTAV, your housing cooperative's assignment system. This guide will help you understand how to use the
    application to participate in the fair housing assignment process.
  </p>

  <h2>What is MTAV?</h2>
  <p>
    MTAV (Best Technology for Housing Assignment) is an application designed to help housing cooperatives distribute
    units fairly among member families. The goal is for each family to receive housing as close as possible to what they
    would have chosen if they could choose freely.
  </p>

  <h2>Important Concepts</h2>

  <h3>Family and Family Atomicity</h3>
  <p><strong>Your family is the basic unit</strong> in MTAV. This means that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>All members of your family will be in the same project</li>
    <li>Your family will receive a single housing unit</li>
    <li>You cannot change projects independently of your family</li>
    <li>Decisions about housing preferences are family-based</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Unit Types</h3>
  <p>
    Your family is assigned to a <strong>specific unit type</strong> (e.g., "Large Family Home" or "Couple Apartment").
    You can only choose from units of that type during the preference process.
  </p>

  <h2>Navigating the Application</h2>

  <h2>Managing Housing Preferences</h2>

  <h3>How Do Preferences Work?</h3>
  <p>
    Preferences are your way of communicating to the system which housing units you prefer. You can rank up to 5 units
    in order of preference:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>First choice</strong>: Your most desired housing unit</li>
    <li><strong>Second choice</strong>: Your second alternative</li>
    <li>And so on...</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Setting Your Preferences</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Go to the <strong>Preferences</strong> section in the menu</li>
    <li>Review the available units of your assigned type</li>
    <li>Select the units you prefer</li>
    <li>Order them according to your preference (drag and drop)</li>
    <li>Save your changes</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Modifying Preferences</h3>
  <p><strong>Before the lottery:</strong> You can change your preferences freely as many times as you want.</p>
  <p><strong>After the lottery:</strong> Preferences are frozen permanently as an audit record.</p>

  <h3>Unit Information</h3>
  <p>For each unit you can see:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Number of bedrooms and bathrooms</li>
    <li>Square meters</li>
    <li>Special characteristics (garden, balcony, etc.)</li>
    <li>Location on the project blueprint (if available)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>The Lottery Process</h2>

  <h3>How Does It Work?</h3>
  <p>The lottery uses advanced mathematical methods to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Consider ALL families' preferences simultaneously</li>
    <li>Maximize overall community satisfaction</li>
    <li>Assign housing units in the fairest possible way</li>
